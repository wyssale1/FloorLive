## Phase 1: Foundation & Routing Architecture

### Task 1.1: Project Architecture Setup
**Goal**: Establish modern React SPA foundation with proper routing structure

**Instructions**:
- Set up TanStack Router with file-based routing structure
- Configure TanStack Query with appropriate default settings for sports data
- Create TypeScript interfaces for all data models (Game, Team, Standing, etc.)
- Set up proper error boundaries and loading states architecture

**Routing Structure Needed**:
- `/` - Home dashboard
- `/games/:date` - Games on specific date
- `/games/:gameId` - Individual game detail
- `/standings` - League standings
- `/teams/:teamId` - Team profile pages

**Success Criteria**:
- Clean file-based routing with proper TypeScript support
- URL state management works for all filters and views
- Query client properly configured for sports data patterns
- Development environment runs smoothly with hot reload

### Task 1.2: URL State Management Strategy
**Goal**: Ensure all user interactions update URLs for shareability

**Instructions**:
- Design URL patterns that capture all relevant filtering states
- Implement search params management for filters (league, date, team)
- Create navigation patterns that maintain URL context
- Set up proper route validation and fallback handling
- Ensure bookmark-ability of all meaningful app states

**URL Patterns Required**:
- `/games/12345` (specific game with shareable link)

**Success Criteria**:
- Every filter combination generates a unique, shareable URL
- URLs can be bookmarked and shared reliably
- Back/forward navigation works intuitively
- Invalid URLs redirect to appropriate fallback states
