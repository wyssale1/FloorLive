## Phase 5: Real-Time Features and Data Synchronization

### Task 5.1: Live Data Updates
**Goal**: Implement background data synchronization for live content

**Instructions**:
- Set up TanStack Query background refetching for live games
- Implement real-time indicators for data freshness
- Create update notifications that don't disrupt user experience
- Design offline functionality for basic cached content
- Add manual refresh capability for user control

**Update Strategy**:
- Live games refetch every 30 seconds automatically
- Background updates don't interrupt user interactions
- Visual indicators show when new data is available
- Failed updates are retried with exponential backoff

**Success Criteria**:
- Live content updates smoothly without user disruption
- Users are appropriately notified of new information
- Offline experience degrades gracefully
- Manual refresh provides immediate feedback

### Task 5.2: Search and Filter Performance
**Goal**: Implement performant search that works with URL state

**Instructions**:
- Create debounced search that updates URL appropriately
- Implement client-side filtering for fast response
- Design search results highlighting and navigation
- Add search history functionality with URL integration
- Optimize large dataset filtering for smooth performance

**Performance Requirements**:
- Search response time under 100ms for client-side filtering
- URL updates smoothly without navigation disruption
- Large datasets (100+ games) filter smoothly
- Search history integrates with browser history

**Success Criteria**:
- Search feels instantaneous across all device types
- Filter combinations work logically and intuitively  
- Search results are easy to navigate and share
- Performance remains smooth with large datasets
