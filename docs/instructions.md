# Swiss Unihockey Tracker - MVP Instructions

## Project Vision
Simple Swiss Unihockey game tracker with two main views:
1. **Main page**: List games in Live/Today/Recent sections
2. **Game detail**: Show team header + event timeline

## Tech Stack
- **React 19** + TypeScript
- **TanStack Router** for routing & URL management
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** for styling
- **Vite** for development

## Core Principles
- **Keep it simple**: Only build what's shown in the screenshots
- **Mobile-first**: Design for phone usage primarily
- **Shareable URLs**: Every game has a unique URL
- **Fast loading**: Use mock data efficiently

## MVP Scope
### ✅ What to build:
- Main page with three game sections

- Basic navigation and routing
- Mobile-responsive design

### ❌ What NOT to build (yet):
- Complex filtering or search
- User accounts or preferences
- Real-time updates (use mock data)

- Statistics or standings

## Development Phases
Execute in order:
1. **Phase 1**: Basic setup & routing
2. **Phase 2**: Main page with game sections  
3. **Phase 3**: Game detail page
4. **Phase 4**: Mobile polish & testing
