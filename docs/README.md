# FloorLive Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the FloorLive project, including design decisions, implementation guides, and analysis documents.

## Documents

### Search & UI Features
- **[SEARCH_FUNCTIONALITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./SEARCH_FUNCTIONALITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Complete documentation of the search functionality design and implementation (temporarily reverted)

### Performance & Optimization  
- **[IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_CRON_ANALYSIS.md](./IMAGE_OPTIMIZATION_CRON_ANALYSIS.md)** - Analysis of image optimization strategies comparing on-demand vs cron job approaches

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming Convention
- Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.md` for major feature documentation
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the content
- Include implementation status in the document (active, planned, reverted, etc.)

### Content Structure
Each major feature document should include:

1. **Overview** - Brief summary and current status
2. **Requirements** - Original user/business requirements  
3. **Architecture** - Technical design and component structure
4. **Implementation Details** - Code examples and technical specifics
5. **User Experience** - UI/UX design decisions
6. **Performance Considerations** - Optimization strategies
7. **Testing Strategy** - How the feature should be tested
8. **Future Roadmap** - Planned improvements and iterations
9. **Lessons Learned** - Key insights from implementation

### Code Examples
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript syntax highlighting
- Include component interfaces and key function signatures
- Show both implementation and usage examples
- Document any complex algorithms or business logic

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new features or making significant changes:

1. Create or update the relevant documentation file
2. Include implementation status and timeline
3. Document any architectural decisions and trade-offs
4. Update this README with links to new documents
5. Ensure code examples are current and functional
