# Search Functionality Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive search functionality implementation that was designed and developed for FloorLive. While this implementation has been temporarily reverted to focus on data organization first, this serves as a complete blueprint for future implementation.

## Project Context

- **Date**: September 7, 2025
- **Status**: Designed and implemented, then reverted for data reorganization
- **Reason for Reversal**: Need to organize data sources properly before implementing search
- **Future Implementation**: Will be re-implemented after data structure optimization

---

## Implementation Summary

### User Requirements

The user requested a search functionality with these specific requirements:

1. **Search Scope**: Search for players and teams using existing JSON data files
2. **UI Design**: Search icon in right corner of header (opposite to back button)
3. **Interaction**: Clicking search transforms header to show search input with search icon on left
4. **User Experience**: Delete input button on right when user types
5. **Visual Effects**: Overlay effect on rest of app (similar to header backdrop effect)
6. **Animations**: Smooth animations for opening/closing search
7. **Results Display**: 
   - Player results use existing PlayerImage component
   - Team results use square container with rounded borders (iOS app icon style) with team logo
8. **Code Quality**: Follow DRY principle and senior developer practices

└── shared/types/
    └── index.ts                  # Extended with search interfaces
```

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Data Sources Identified**:
   - Teams: `/backend/data/teams-master.json` - Team IDs, names, aliases, logos
   - Players: API endpoints `/api/teams/{id}` - Team roster data
   - Search Index: `/backend/assets/players/search_index.json` - For future optimization

2. **Search Strategy**:
   - **Client-side team search** from teams-master.json
   - **Dynamic player loading** from team APIs with caching
   - **Debounced input** (300ms) to prevent excessive API calls
   - **Smart ranking algorithm** with scoring system

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
// Added to shared/types/index.ts

export interface SearchResult {
  type: 'player' | 'team';
  id: string;
  name: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  image?: string;
  teamId?: string;
  jerseyNumber?: string;
  team?: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  };
}

export interface UseSearchOptions {
  debounceMs?: number;
  maxResults?: number;
}

export interface UseSearchReturn {
  query: string;
  results: SearchResult[];
  isLoading: boolean;
  isOpen: boolean;
  setQuery: (query: string) => void;
  openSearch: () => void;
  closeSearch: () => void;
  clearResults: () => void;
}
```

### 2. Search Hook (`useSearch.ts`)

**Key Features**:
- Debounced search with configurable delay (default 300ms)
- Team data caching from teams-master.json
- Player data caching from team APIs
- Intelligent ranking system with match scoring
- Result limiting (default 20 results)
- Loading state management

**Ranking Algorithm**:
- Exact match: 100 points
- Starts with query: 80 points  
- Word boundary match: 70 points
- Contains query: 50 points

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Client-side team filtering (no API calls)
- Cached player data from previous team visits
- Debounced input to reduce API load
- Result pagination/limiting

### 3. UI Components

- **Animated icons**: Search icon → Clear button when typing
- **Smooth transitions** with Framer Motion
- **Proper focus management** and accessibility
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (ESC to close)

#### SearchResults Components
- **Grouped results**: Separate sections for teams and players
- **Loading states**: Spinner animation
- **Empty states**: Contextual messages with icons
- **Result summary**: Shows count and query in footer
- **Staggered animations**: Results appear with delay

#### PlayerSearchResult Component
- **Reuses existing PlayerImage component** (DRY principle)
- **Jersey number badges** with responsive sizing
- **Team information** in subtitle

### 4. Backend API Support

**New Endpoint**: `/api/teams-master`
- Serves teams-master.json data for search
- Proper error handling for missing files
- Integrated into main Express app (index.ts)

```javascript
// GET /api/teams-master - Get all teams data for search
app.get('/api/teams-master', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const teamsFilePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'data', 'teams-master.json');
    const teamsData = await fs.promises.readFile(teamsFilePath, 'utf-8');
    const parsedData = JSON.parse(teamsData);
    res.json(parsedData);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(404).json({ 
      error: 'Teams master data not found',
      message: 'teams-master.json file not found'
    });
  }
});
```

### 5. Header Integration

**Changes to Header.tsx**:
- Added search icon button in right section
- State management for overlay visibility
- Smooth icon animations with AnimatePresence
- SearchOverlay component integration
- Maintained existing back button and logo functionality

**Animation Specifications**:
- Search icon fade in/out: 0.2s duration
- Overlay backdrop: matching header blur effect
- Content entrance: 0.25s with easeOut timing
- Results stagger: 0.05s delay between items
